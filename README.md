# Chuck Norris Joke Generator 

## Data

## Background  

This is my first project during my time in Flatiron's Software Engineering Live Bootcamp Program, designed to showcase students' applied knowledge of vanilla JavaScript. The basic requirements were to create a single-page web application using data from a free API of our choice and storing it on json-server. My cohort-mate [Ali](https://github.com/aschurman1121) was my parner for this project. 

## Description 

This generator will bring laughs, shock and action into your life. //In true// form, the generator allows the user to post their own joke but gather inspriation from the Chuck Norris Approved joke simulator. 

In building this web application, we showcased our knowledge of vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. With event listeners, we created a mouseover, submit event, and a click event for a button that renders through 600+ Chuck Norris jokes. The mouseover event is showcased on the 'Add Joke' button, flashing an inviting white as the cursor moves over the button. Our submit event in the add joke form processes the jokes, for Chuck's approval of course, and places those that pass by the other Chuck-approved jokes. Last but not least, on the click of a button, the jokes previously approved by Chuck are rendered through and placed on the screen for the user to see. 

We styled this page to emote high action, power-packed jokes. Showcasing CSS skills with a dynamic image background, added fonts, and a user-friendly interface. Keeping with continuity each element on the page uses the same color scheme and border choices. 


## How to Run

1. You must have JSON server on your local machine 
2. Then, in your terminal, run the following command: 
    `json-server --watch db.json` 
3. Open the index.html file & prepare to laugh!
