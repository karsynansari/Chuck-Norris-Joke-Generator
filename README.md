## About 

This generator will bring laughs, shock and action into your life. //In true// form the generator allows the user to post their own joke but gather inspriation from the Chuck Norris Approved joke simulator. 

In this project we showcase the use of Event Listeners, vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Within our event listeners we created a mouseover, submit event and a button that renders through 600+ jokes. The mouseover event is showcased on the 'Add Joke' button, flashing an inviting white as the cursor moves over the button. Our submit event in the add joke form processes the jokes, for Chuck's approval of course, and places those that pass by the other Chuck approved jokes. Last but not least, on the click of a button the jokes previously approved by Chuck are rendered through and placed on the screen for the user to see. 

We styled this page to emote high action, power-packed jokes. Showcasing CSS skills with a dynamic image background, added fonts and a user-friendly interface. Keeping with continuity each element on the page uses the same color scheme and border choices.
